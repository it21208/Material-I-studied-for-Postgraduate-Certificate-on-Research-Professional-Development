I did job shadowing for 1 whole day with an external organisation called Newslines in Glasgow.
The purpose of the job shadowing was to get familiarised with the pipeline of the Newslines company 
in order to do the following tasks: 

Text processing on media news stream using Python (libraries: nltk, beautiful soup, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, re, etc.)
- Understanding the wordpress structure of mysql Newslines DB for schema objects and their relations primary and foreign keys, etc.
- Extracting the original source links from summary articles.
- Fetching the HTML (scraping ) content from the source URLs.
- Extraction of clean text and title of articles found on the WWW to reduce editorial time.
- Extraction of named events - for classifcation - (text feature extraction, tokenization, build-analysis of text, 
bag of words representation, common and tfâ€“idf term weighting vectorizer usage, train and test with ML models (lda, svm, etc.) ).

On the 23rd of April 2019 I attended a pre-CHI SICSA event full-day which was
hosted in the University of Dundee. Although computer and human 
interaction is not my main concentration domain, I took the initiative to participate
in this event in order to gain more knowledge and understanding regarding 
research progress in this particular research field. 
I also had the pleasure to go over some poster presentations and understand 
some of the qualitative techniques and quantitave tools used to process data.
